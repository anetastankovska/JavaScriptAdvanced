BeerApp is a simple page that contains information about different types of beers. 
It has three links in the navigation bar and a search bar
1. The first link "BeerBar" is the home page where the application greets the user. 

2. The second link "Beers" shows information about all beers.
- Two features are added to this page: "Show" and "Sort by". 
    * "Show" drop-down menu lets us pick how many beers should appear on a single page. 
    * "Sort by" drop-down menu lets us sort the beers by: name, alcohol, date whet it was first brewed and bitterness.
- At the bottom of the page appear two buttons that let the user navigate through pages via "Previous page" and "Next page" buttons.
- For each bear is created a card containing a picture, name short description and a "More details" button. When the "More Details" button is clicked, the page shows more details about the selected beer. 
   The details contain information about the following:

3. The third link "RandomBeer" picks a beer randomly and shows detailed information about the beers. 
- The format of the details is the same as those showing when "More details" buttot is clicked for any beer. 
- The user can return to the "Beers" page by clicking to "Back to beers" button.

4. The search bar searches by a letter or a keyword contained in the name of the beer.
